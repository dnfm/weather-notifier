weather-notifier

Simple libnotify weather updater.

This app fetches the weather from weather underground, and displays it on your
desktop using libnotify.

To work properly, you must be using a notify daemon that supports images and
tables.  How it will look on more lightweight notification daemons is
undefined, but feel free to hack it so that it works for your needs.

The config file is where you set your local weather station code, your api key,
and other config settings.

It requires the following perl modules:
    - LWP::UserAgent
    - Try::Tiny
    - Desktop::Notify
    - FindBin
    - List::Util
    - JSON::Parse

Then, just run it, and it should begin updating.  You can specify how often it
updates, and whether you only want updates if the weather has changed.

Feel free to file bugs on github, or email me at github@datademons.com for more
help.
